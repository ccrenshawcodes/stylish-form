/* TODO:

- spin up a "submission success" page
- spin up a 404 page
- wire up Submit button functionality
- wire up Select... button functionality
    - this should replace "Select..." with their selection
    - and ideally add it to the posted data....... idk how that would
    work.

- better background/copy
- carousel?
- color theme toggle
- footer with github icon etc.
